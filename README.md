and trust issue with the existing chat application providers. we use the most
lightweight, clean, and Google’s preferred programming language for Android apps

party chat SDK is from MirrorFly Chat. Example: If Bob and Alice are couples and

they uncomfortable with chatting in third party app’s, So that Bob asked me to create
a chat application and here how it’s work. 1.Bob and Alice install this application
directly through the android studio sharing via network and It’s need only one used
